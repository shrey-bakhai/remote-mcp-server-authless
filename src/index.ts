			"Tim Cook": (q, c) => `I'm absolutely here to support you. ${c ? 'Understanding your context, ' : ''}I believe we need to focus on three key areas: people, strategy, and execution. 

Let me be transparent with you - that's how I've always approached leadership at Apple. Are we thinking long-term here? Are we including diverse perspectives in our decision-making? Most importantly, are our actions aligned with our values?

You know, I've learned that innovation isn't just about technology - it's about creating solutions that genuinely improve people's lives. I always build consensus with my team. The best decisions come from collaborative thinking, not top-down mandates.

So I'm curious - what specific outcome are you hoping to achieve? And how does it benefit not just your business, but your community? Because that's where real, sustainable success comes from.`,

			"Warren Buffett": (q, c) => `Well hello there! Let me start with the fundamentals. ${c ? 'From what you\'ve told me, ' : ''}My first question is always: Do you understand this business deeply? If you can't explain it simply to me, you probably don't understand it well enough yourself.

I always look for the competitive moat. Is this a wonderful business at a fair price, or are we chasing something flashy? You see, time is the friend of the wonderful business and the enemy of the mediocre one.

My advice to you? Be patient. I've seen too many smart people let market noise or short-term pressures push them into bad decisions. I focus on intrinsic value, not stock prices or quarterly results. And never, ever forget my Rule #1: Don't lose money.

Here's my test: Can you hold this investment or decision for 10 years without losing sleep? If not, don't make it. That's how I've built Berkshire Hathaway.`,

			"Maya Angelou": (q, c) => `My dear friend, I am here, and I want you to know that courage is the most important of all virtues. Without courage, you cannot practice any other virtue consistently. ${c ? 'I hear your heart in what you\'ve shared, and ' : ''}I want you to remember this: you may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.

Leadership isn't about having all the answers - it's about how you make people feel. When people work with you, do they feel valued? Do they feel heard? Do they feel they can grow? These are the questions that matter.

My mission in life has never been merely to survive, but to thrive - with passion, compassion, humor, and style. I want you to bring that same energy to your challenge. 

Ask yourself: How can I be a rainbow in someone else's cloud today? How can my leadership lift others up? Because people will forget what you said and did, but they will never forget how you made them feel.`,

			"Jamie Dimon": (q, c) => `Let me be completely direct with you - that's how I operate. ${c ? 'Looking at what you\'ve described, ' : ''}I need facts, analysis, and detail. Then more facts, analysis, and detail. You can never do enough of this, and it never ends.

Here's what I've learned running JPMorgan: Don't start with a narrative and fit the numbers to it. Start with the numbers and let them tell you the story. I assess everything honestly, directly, and forthrightly. A lot of companies don't do this, and that's where they get into trouble.

You need grit to make tough decisions and stick with them. But you also need humility - whether I'm talking to the person cleaning our offices or another CEO, I treat everyone with respect.

My philosophy is simple: Don't blow up. I build for the long term. We don't worry about stock prices in the short run - if you build a great company, the stock price takes care of itself. So tell me - what specific data do you have, and what is it actually telling you?`,

			"Charlie Munger": (q, c) => `Well, let me invert this problem for you. ${c ? 'Given what you\'ve described, ' : ''}Instead of asking what will make you successful, I ask: what will definitely make you fail? Then I avoid those things religiously.

Show me the incentives, and I'll show you the outcome. I want you to look at your situation - what are the real incentives at play here? People respond to incentives, not good intentions. That's human nature.

I've always believed it's not enough to be rational - you must avoid the standard stupidities. Are you falling into any psychological traps? Confirmation bias? Overconfidence? I've seen brilliant people destroyed by these.

My advice is to develop what I call a lattice of mental models from multiple disciplines. Don't just think about this as a business problem - what can psychology, physics, biology teach you about this situation? 

Remember: I achieve extraordinary performance by avoiding stupidity, not by being brilliant. Most people try too hard to be clever when they should focus on not being dumb.`,

			"Art Gensler": (q, c) => `I apply design thinking to every challenge, not just buildings. ${c ? 'Looking at your situation, ' : ''}My first question is always: Who is your client? What problem are you really trying to solve for them?

You see, great design isn't about making things look pretty - it's about making them work better for people. Form follows function, but both must serve human needs. That's been my philosophy for decades.

I've always believed in putting the client first, listening carefully to what they need, then collaborating with great teams to exceed their expectations. That's how we built Gensler into what it is today.

My approach would be to map out the entire experience you're trying to create. What does success look like from your client's perspective? How can you design a solution that's not just functional, but delightful?

Remember, innovation comes from collaboration. I bring together diverse perspectives, encourage wild ideas, then iterate rapidly. The best solutions usually emerge from the intersection of different viewpoints. That's where the magic happens.`
